Assignment 1 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)
	
This assignment went quite well for me. It was a good refresher of programming and way to get back to programming after break. Too, I feel like the assignment was a good introduction to C and the material we have covered so far. 

2. What was hard about this assignment?

I did not get the scanf() shortcut with the whitespace reading until you posted the hint on the course website for the Assignment. As a result, I spend a LOT of time banging my head, metaphorically of course, on a table about the calculator part of the assignment. The hint really helped and showed me that my code was working except for that one part. 

3. What would you like to know more about?

I would like to you to know that I enjoy programming and that I also appreciate opportunities to ask questions outside of class. I plan to come into your office hours a lot. :) 

4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)

This assignment took me about 3-4 hours all in. However, I had a lot of trouble with the calculator portion of the assignment, since I did not realize the scanf() shortcut concerning not reading whitespace characters.
